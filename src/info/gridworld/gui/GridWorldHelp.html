	<h1>Pokemon Help</h1>
	<p><strong>Controls: </strong>Keyboard and Mouse. Arrow keys to move around, 'S' to save game and 'P' to show current Pokedex.</p>
	<p><strong>Goal: </strong>The goal of Pokemon is to collect all the Pokemon and win against the final four trainers in the Elite Four to become the Pokemon world champion.</p>
	<p><strong>Gameplay: </strong>You are a trainer in an enclosed world map. Along the various routes there will be patches of grass where you can encounter other wild Pokemon. Pokemon are the creatures
with which you fight in the Pokemon world. Each Pokemon has a type and their attacks also have types. Some types are stronger against some types and weaker against others. To catch a Pokemon 
you will click 'Catch' and throw a Pokeball at it. Sometimes the Pokeball will fail and you will have to try again. If you would like to give up there is a “Run” button which will enable 
you to end the battle. During the Elite Four you will have to use your Pokemon to bring their Pokemon's health down to zero, which will cause them to faint. You win a battle if you
faint all their Pokemon before they feint all of yours.  If all of your Pokemon faint your game will be over. Your party of Pokemon can only consist of six Pokemon at a time.  
The Elite Four are the four hardest trainers in the entire league. If you can defeat them you will become the World Champion and win the game. </p>
	<p><strong>Scoring: </strong>At the end of the game your score will be the time it took to defeat the Elite Four.</p>
	<p><strong>Data: </strong>Before the Elite Four the saved data will be which Pokemon you have caught. Afterwards it will be your current Party and what Elite Four you are currently on.</p>
